    <h1>
        Big Road
    </h1>

    <p>This is a simplist solution to a mobile-only web story. Users with no coding background should be able to use this template after a 10 minute crash course on HTML. One does not need to learn CSS, in order to make it work in a reasonable way.</p>

    <h2> Features </h2>

    <p>
        "Big Road" has the following key features:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>HTML only</strong> -- Actually, you don't need to learn HTML. Just get the code of current page and modify it.
        </li>
        <li>Sensible default style.</li>
        <li>Common elements:
            <code>p, em, strong</code>
        </li>
        <li>Snippet for responsive embedding of interactive charts, via <code>iframe</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Getting started </h2>

    <p>Make your first web story in three steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Fork this repository</li>
        <li>Modify <code>index.html</code> to include your content</li>
        <li>Your web story is available on `username.github.io/big-road`</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Demo of supported elements for your article</h2>

    <p>
        You have already seen headings (<code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>), listings (<code>ul</code>, <code>ol</code>, <code>li</code>), and paragraph (<code>p</code>) in previous codes. In this section, we show you several other useful
        elements.
    </p>

    <h3>Highlight texts in a paragraph</h3>

    <p>
        In a pragraph, there may be some key information that you want to highlight. In HTML, we have two basic semantic tags for this purpose. You can <em>emphasize something</em> , or <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong>. The difference here
        is subtle and the choice depends on the author.
    </p>

    <h3>Image with caption</h3>

    <picture>
        <img src="images/screenshot-demo.png" alt="">
        <caption>
            <em> How "Big Road" looks like on mobile phone.</em>
            <br> Source: screenshot
        </caption>
    </picture>

    <picture>
        <img src="images/screenshot-demo.png" alt="">
        <caption>
            Sometimes, the caption can be very long which is a standalone story by itself. So you don't have to put the entire block into emphasis mode. Just <em>emaphsize the part you find most important</em>.
        </caption>
    </picture>

    <p>Note, an image aspect ratio of 16:9 is recommended as a sensible default.</p>

    <h3>Responsive video embedding</h3>

    <p>Embedding videos in a responsive manner is always a pain. The conventional technique is to embed by <code>iframe</code>. You need to specify the width and height of the iframe, making it non-responsive to different screens.</p>

    <p>Use Youtube as an example. You can copy the following code of
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4">this video</a> from its "Share --> Embed" button:
    </p>

    <p><code>
        &#x3C;iframe width=&#x22;560&#x22; height=&#x22;315&#x22; src=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qp0HIF3SfI4&#x22; frameborder=&#x22;0&#x22; allow=&#x22;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#x22; allowfullscreen&#x3E;&#x3C;/iframe&#x3E;
    </code></p>

    <!-- <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qp0HIF3SfI4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> -->

    <p>The default result is as follows:</p>

    <picture>
        <img src="images/responsive-embedding-video.png" alt="">
        <caption>
            Default iframe embedding is not responsive to the screen width. It is either too small or too big.
        </caption>
    </picture>

    <p>
        Following is one responsive video. You can check the source code of this page to see how it works. You don't have to completely understand the internal works. Simply subsituting the URL suffices.
    </p>

    <responsive-block>
        <iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/qp0HIF3SfI4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>
    </responsive-block>
