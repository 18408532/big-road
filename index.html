    <h1>
        Big Road
    </h1>

    <p>This is a simplist solution to a mobile-only web story. Users with no coding background should be able to use this template after a 10 minute crash course on HTML. One does not need to learn CSS, in order to make it work in a reasonable way.</p>

    <h2> Features </h2>

    <p>
        "Big Road" has the following key features:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>HTML only</strong> -- Actually, you don't need to learn HTML. Just get the code of current page and modify it.
        </li>
        <li>Sensible default style.</li>
        <li>Common elements:
            <code>p, em, strong</code>
        </li>
        <li>Snippet for responsive embedding of interactive charts, via <code>iframe</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Getting started </h2>

    <p>Make your first web story in three steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Fork this repository</li>
        <li>Modify <code>index.html</code> to include your content</li>
        <li>Your web story is available on `username.github.io/big-road`</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Demo of supported elements for your article</h2>

    <p>
        You have already seen headings (<code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code>), listings (<code>ul</code>, <code>ol</code>, <code>li</code>), and paragraph (<code>p</code>) in previous codes. In this section, we show you several other useful
        elements.
    </p>

    <h3>Highlight texts in a paragraph</h3>

    <p>
        In a pragraph, there may be some key information that you want to highlight. In HTML, we have two basic semantic tags for this purpose. You can <em>emphasize something</em> , or <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong>. The difference here
        is subtle and the choice depends on the author.
    </p>

    <h3>Image with caption</h3>

        <img src="images/screenshot-demo.png" alt="">
        <caption>
            <em> How "Big Road" looks like on mobile phone.</em>
            <br> Source: screenshot
        </caption>
    </picture>

    <picture>
        <img src="images/screenshot-demo.png" alt="">
        <caption>
            Sometimes, the caption can be very long which is a standalone story by itself. So you don't have to put the entire block into emphasis mode. Just <em>emaphsize the part you find most important</em>.
        </caption>

    <p>Note, an image aspect ratio of 16:9 is recommended as a sensible default.</p>

    <h3>Responsive video embedding</h3>
